\begin{enumerate}

\item Given an LFSR with an irreducible characteristic polynomial $f(X)$ there 
are two cases of initial state to consider. If the initial state is zero then 
the period of the LFSR is 1, and therefore divides $2^{L} - 1$. If the initial
state is non-zero then all sequences generated by $f(X)$ have the same period, 
and this period divides $2^{L} - 1$ (\cite{slides}, Theorem 3).

\item Let $p$ be an irredicuible polynomial of degree $5$ and let $s$ be a non-trivial
sequence generated by $p$. Then the period of $s$ divides $2^5-1=31$, so is $1$ or $31$.
But $s$ is non-trivial, so the period is $31$. This is the order of its minimal polynomial
(\cite{slides}, Theorem 2), which must be $p$ since $p$ is an irreducible characteristic
polynomial. So the order of $p$ is $2^5-1$, and $p$ is primitive.
