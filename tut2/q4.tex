\begin{enumerate}

\item

\item Let $p$ be an irredicuible polynomial of degree $5$ and let $s$ be a non-trivial
sequence generated by $p$. Then the period of $s$ divides $2^5-1=31$, so is $1$ or $31$.
But $s$ is non-trivial, so the period is $31$. This is the order of its minimal polynomial
(\cite{slides}, Theorem 2), which must be $p$ since $p$ is an irreducible characteristic
polynomial. So the order of $p$ is $2^5-1$, and $p$ is primitive.
